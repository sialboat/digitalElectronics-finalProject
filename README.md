## Digital Electronics Final Project
This file displays my code and other miscellaneous assets used for my NYU F24 Digital Electronics final project.
My final project draws a triangle on a ILI9341 screen and lets you control its direction and rotation using two joysticks.
These two joysticks have momentum-based movement, meaning that the triangle will smoothly accelerate and decelerate between
angular and positional values.

For more information on the concepts that the project is built upon, please refer to the project [report]([report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EwBQhJmSSoC8HgRFptuw8qkn9xVgbsGXSP5RETaCfTY/edit?usp=sharing))
